  <h2> How to Play? </h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to our simple and hopefully fun (and playable) game. We were hoping this game
    would be pretty straight forward but if you have to ask how to play then we won't judge (maybe).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> You will start as an object in the middle. That is you, for now, small and insignificant.
    <li> Soon balls starting to bounce across the screen. Use the arrow keys to avoid these and all will go well.
    <li> Balls are added every 5 seconds, the amount of balls on the screen will indicate your current score. You can check the whole list of score by going to rankings in the navbar.
 <p> Enjoy! </p>
